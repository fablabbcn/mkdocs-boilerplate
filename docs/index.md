!!! info "What is this?"
    This repo is a compilation of tools and useful macros that can be used to make _recursive documentation_ and more complex autogenerated sites based on mkdocs.

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

## Extra stuff

You will see in some pages a one or two buttons on top. One for making the page "Fullscreen" (in every page) and another one for a PDF download, which you can add as an attachment. Check here an example for the PDF feature.
