# README

This is a small demo repository for nesting (i.e. including files from the same repo or other repos) in the `mkdocs` building process. Builds on top of the `macros-plugin` and draws from [`mkdocs-snippet-plugin`](https://github.com/mprivat/mkdocs-snippet-plugin) and the [markdown snippet](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/) extension.

Three modes are supported:

* Relative imports (make sure to include the whole path relative to the repo main dir):

```
{{ get_snippet_rel('docs/index.md', '## Commands')}}
```

* Remote imports:

You can do the same from an external url (it has to be a `.md` file if you want it to be rendered):

```
{{ get_snippet_url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-docs/master/docs/index.md', '## Sections')}}
```

Or from an external git repo (same as above) - **but very slow!** (make sure it has https or your repo has access to the remote git repo):

```
{{ get_snippet_git('https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-minke-docs', 'docs/Guides/getting started/Debugging your sensors.md', '# Debugging your sensors')}}
```

**May take a while**: It may take a while if you use this last option because the repo is cloned everytime. It is clone in your `/tmp` folder (by default - you can change it in your `mkdocs.yml` file) - so if something doesn't work check your terminal output (not tested on every platform)

When doing it from a remote git repo, make sure to:

	- Delete the `__gen__` autogenerated folder
	- Do `mkdocs serve` or `mkdocs build`
	- Add - commit as usual. Add the `__gen__` folder too, but with caution, as it may contain many images!
